The Employee Survey project is one that I am currently working on with Johns Hopkins University and Johns Hopkins Health System. 
The purpose of this project is to provide the Employee Health and Wellness Center located on Hopkins East Baltimore Campus with a way to track their feedback from employee's after they are seen by nurse practicioners at the center.
Prior to this application, employees were encouraged to send feedback via email or telephone. This project is one of many that I am apart of encouraging our occupational health team to incorporate a effecient use of technology. 

The completion of this project will allow employees to submit employee satisfaction forms, data in which will be held in a SQL server. 
As we get closer to the end of this project updated changes for this will no longer be updated in this repository, in order to remain compliant with dept standards and requests.
